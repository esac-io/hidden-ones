  Well, everyone knows how hard writing can be (even more challenging
  using a non-native language), so this blog was created as an attempt
  to improve this particular skill, and as a positive side effect,
  add a little bit more information on the =internet=, the data sea
  that we all love and/or hate.

  Although, the intent is to write about anything that sparkles
  interest, the main focus will be on the following subjects:

  - Philosophy
  - Mathematics
  - Functional Programming
  - Emacs
  - Lisp Dialects
    - Elisp
    - Clojure
    - Common Lisp
    - Scheme
  - FreeBSD

  So, grab me cup of boiling hot coffee *(without sugar, thanks)*, map
  out your life, and lets rock it!

  At this point doesn't matter, does it?

  Let's leave the work do the talking, beware though,
  the posts contents comes from a very disturbed mind and
  can be to much for some people, be careful,
  but at least be happy :)

  Litany Against Fear

  I must not fear.
  Fear is the mind-killer.
  Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
  I will face my fear.
  I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
  And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing.
  Only I will remain.
