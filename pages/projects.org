* VLM

  Just another Emacs configuration written in the literate
  programming format with the help of [[https://orgmode.org][orgmode]], that has a simple
  goal: be just a configuration file, i.e, set custom values and
  hooks for the libraries of interest.

  Some people (including me) have started to refer to =Emacs= as a
  =LISP MACHINE=. It is not strictly a lisp machine because, clearly,
  it is a software program and not a physical computer, but as that line
  starts to blur it seems like a useful epithet for Emacs, because
  these days it looks more and more like an *Operating System*.

* Cannon

  An Elisp library that mimics the beloved [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][Dmenu]] to launch unix
  utilities using the command prompt =minibuffer= interface.

  Going into detail, *Cannon* is a simple lightweight package that has
  no outside dependencies, relying on =completing-read= builtin
  =C=-function, providing completions collections plus mechanisms to
  launch applications - the process creation - directly from Emacs.

  The projectâ€™s name itself is a little joke about launching =Chrome=
  web browser: a heavily metal ball that causes nightmares.
