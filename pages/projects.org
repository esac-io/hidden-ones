  Just another =org-mode= based =Emacs= configuration,
  =org-mode= is used to write and organize the configuration
  in a literate programming format.

  This project also can be viewed as an =Elisp= interpreter desktop
  distribution providing the universal IO bridge between the
  human mind and the machine resources, managed by the operating
  system.

  In other words, an Emacs configuration well designed and
  integrated that provides a generic computer environment
  for everyday use.
