* VLM

  Just another *Emacs* configuration written in the literate
  programming format with the help of [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]], that has a simple
  goal - be just a configuration file, i.e, set custom values and
  hooks for the libraries of interest.

  Some people (including me) have started to refer to Emacs as a LISP MACHINE.
  It is not strictly a lisp machine because, clearly, it is a software
  program and not a physical computer, but as that line starts to blur
  it seems like a useful epithet for *Emacs*, because these days it
  looks more and more like an =OS=.

* Cannon

  An *Elisp* library that mimics the beloved [[https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/][Dmenu]] to launch =Unix=
  utilities using the *Emacs* command prompt interface, a.k.a, the
  =minibuffer=.

  The projectâ€™s name itself is a joke about launching
  =Chrome= web browser inside *Emacs/Exwm* - a heavy metal ball that
  causes nightmares.

* Ddoc

  An Elisp library that provides instant offline access/management of
  more then 200 *Dash* documentation sets. It doesn't require *Dash*
  application, we rely on any *html* file browser, however *Eww* text
  based browser is highly recommended!

* Lazy-Load

  An Elisp library that provides automatic generation of load
  definitions (autoloads) from pre-configured directories, i.e,
  other libraries, accelerating *Emacs* initialization process.

  | Lazy-Load | (emacs-init-time)   |
  | No        | 4.871672671 seconds |
  | Yes       | 0.489159734 seconds |

* Ob-elixir

  An Elisp library that adds Elixir language support, i.e,
  code evaluation to Org-babel. Babel provides what is known as
  literate programming to org-mode.

* Rfc-docs

  An Elisp library that provides facilities to search, fetch and read
  RFC text documents.

* Lex

  Libraries Extensions - little hacks for vanilla Emacs.

  An simple library that extends other libraries (mainly builtin ones) -
  a place to put new functions to be evaluated - little hacks to improve
  *Emacs* overall usability keeping everything more organized,
  providing a safe place to add new hacks.

* Wall

  An Elisp library that provides management of wallpapers using
  feh(1) - or any other unix related utility - to draw the chosen
  image.
